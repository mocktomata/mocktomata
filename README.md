`komondor` is your friendly guard dog to write test across service boundary.

Service boundary is defined as a boundary between two systems that communicate with each other using data structures and primitive types.

Two common forms of service boundary are ajax call and rpc.

When writing test across service boundary,
one challenge is keeping the stub data you use in your unit test current.

Making boundary calls are expensive.
The setup required to make the remote service to return the specific response you are looking for is expensive and time consuming,
we often have to create stub data and use them in the test.

But these stub data can create false positive when the remove service is updated.

Since we run our unit test in an enclosed enviornment using the stub data,
it is not possible to detect the problem quickly,
and have to resort to system tests.

This library is designed to tickle that problem.

## spec(fn, options): Promise<Spec<T>>

To write test for a service boundary,
you will do a test waltz:

- create a test that makes real calls
- save the call result
- replay the call result

## Todo

- Complete README
- Add global config
- Add scenario

## Contribute

```sh
# right after fork
npm install

# begin making changes
git checkout -b <branch>
npm run watch

# edit `webpack.config.dev.js` to exclude dependencies for the global build.

# after making change(s)
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git push

# create PR
```

## Npm Commands

There are a few useful commands you can use during development.

```sh
# Run tests (and lint) automatically whenever you save a file.
npm run watch

# Run tests with coverage stats (but won't fail you if coverage does not meet criteria)
npm run test

# Manually verify the project.
# This will be ran during 'npm preversion' so you normally don't need to run this yourself.
npm run verify

# Build the project.
# You normally don't need to do this.
npm run build

# Run tslint
# You normally don't need to do this as `npm run watch` and `npm version` will automatically run lint for you.
npm run lint
```
