# Advance Use Cases

Besides using [`mocktomata`][mocktomata] during tests,
you can also use [`mocktomata`][mocktomata] in production code.

This will enable some advance use cases.

The specific features for these use cases will be available soon.
But there is what it will be capable of:

## Live Debug Recording

If your customer reports a problem,
you can get into a live debug session with your customer and turn on recording.
Then you can record the complete behavior and reproduce it later on.

## Recorded Demo

How many times did you run a live demo, and it did not go as planned?

With [`mocktomata`][mocktomata],
you can record your action and replay it live.
