Welcome to [mocktomata], the behavior simulation system.

My name is `mockto`.

I'm the main automaton and your guide around here.

In a nutshell, [mocktomata] saves the behavior of your code,
and simulate it at a later time.

We can isolate your code from the changes and uncertainty of the outside world.
And we can connect your code back to it by a flip of a switch.

That means, instead of manually writing mocks, you can write e2e tests,
and run them as e2e or as unit tests.
