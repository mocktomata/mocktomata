# `@mocktomata/service`

`@mocktomata/service` starts a running service to handle requests from [`@mocktomata/io-remote`].

## Used by

- [`@mocktomata/cli`]: `mocktomata server <action>` to `start/stop` the service.

## Depends on

- [`@mocktomata/nodejs`]: Currently depends on it directly. In the future, [`@mocktomata/cli`] will depend on it, and it is injected into `@mocktomata/service`.
- `@mocktomata/data (TBD)`: The future package extracted from [`@mocktomata/nodejs`] to handle various data validation and sanitization.
